The Simple IoT hardware currently consists of a gateway with a
[Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/) socket that works with
modules from
[Particle](https://store.particle.io/collections/prototyping-hardware) and
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/feather). Multiple sensor/IO nodes can be
attach to the gateway and daisychained for 10's of feet. The system is
waterproof and uses low cost
[xConnect](https://www.wiredwatts.com/3-core-xconnect-connector) 3-wire
connectors.

The hardware designs are implemented in KiCad and
